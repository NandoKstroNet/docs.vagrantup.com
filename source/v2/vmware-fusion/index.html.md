# VMware Fusion

[HashiCorp](http://www.hashicorp.com) develops an official
[VMware Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/overview.html)&nbsp;
[provider](/v2/providers/index.html) for Vagrant. This provider allows
Vagrant to power VMware Fusion based machines and take advantage of the
improved stability and performance that Fusion offers.

Learn more about the VMware Fusion provider on the
[VMware Fusion provider](http://www.vagrantup.com/vmware) page on
the Vagrant website.

This provider is a drop-in replacement for VirtualBox, meaning that every
VirtualBox feature that Vagrant supports is fully functional in Fusion as
well. However, there are some Fusion-specific things such as box formats,
configurations, etc. that are documented here.

The VMware Fusion provider is currently compatible only with Fusion 5.
Fusion 5 must be purchased and installed separately prior to using the
provider. If Fusion isn't properly installed, or an invalid version is
installed, the provider will give you a human-friendly error message.

Use the navigation to the left to find a specific Fusion topic to read
more about.
