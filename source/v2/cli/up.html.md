# Up

**Command: `vagrant up`**

This command creates and configures guest machines according to your
[Vagrantfile](/v2/vagrantfile/index.html).

This is the single most important command in Vagrant, since it is how
any Vagrant machine is created. Anyone using Vagrant must use this command
on a day-to-day basis.
